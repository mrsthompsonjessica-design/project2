<h2>Homeschool Beliefs</h2>

<p>Here on the ranch we homeschool in a very relaxed and ecletic way. Since E has special needs, we remove the pressures that public school puts on kids and allow for a more go with the flow pace. Additionally, he learns differently for different subjects, so we do not use pre-packaged curriculum. We believe in a low pressure, individualized approach, just like we live our lives.</p>
