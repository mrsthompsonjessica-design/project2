<h2>Curriculum</h2>

<p>We use a variety of curriculum in our homeschool year. Sometimes we keep it simple and free, for example <a href="https://allinonehomeschool.com/">Easy Peasy All-in-One Homeschool.</a> Other times we use purchased curriculum to give ourselves a little more guidance and challenge.</p>

<p>This year starting high school, we chose to keep things simple and use Easy Peasy. Lee has done a fantastic job outlining the key elements needed for high school and it allows us to assign individual subjects on the "grade level" he is at. For example, E needed a little more practice at the beginning of the year with language arts, so we chose to utilize the 8th grade path for the first semester. That was just what he needed, and now, heading into second semester, we are bumping up the challenge and utilizing the <a href= "https://allinonehighschool.com/litandcomp1/">Literature and Composition I</a> found on <a href="https://allinonehighschool.com/">All-in-One High School.</a> Additionally, E is taking Biology, World History, Health, Culinary Arts and HTML all through Easy Peasy. And the best part for us is, it's free!</p>

<p>Outside of Easy Peasy, we are also utilizing <a href="https://www.ixl.com/">iXL</a> for math. E really struggles with math and we have found that iXL does a wonderful job
highlighting his strengths and weaknesses and allows us to focus on the gaps before moving on to Algrebra I next year.</p>
