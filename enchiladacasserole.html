<h2>Enchilada Casserole</h2>

<p><b>This isn't your typical enchiladas..</b></p>

<p>There are many aspects of being a wife and mother that I enjoy. Feeding my family and seeing their satisfaction with full bellies is at the top of my list, though. Over the years, our family has found many things we enjoy – we are kind of a bunch of foodies really. But one of our go-to family recipes that is always a hit is Enchilada Casserole. Originally passed down to me from my mother, it is a quick and easy meal that can be thrown together easily on a weeknight, or, like my family loves to do, make a double batch to feed a crowd! My son, E, requests it at least every other month, and many years for his birthday.</p>


<p><b>What is in Enchilada Casserole?</b></p>
<p>Enchilada Casserole is oh so cheesy and creamy with its mounds of shredded cheese and rich mixture of cream of chicken soup and sour cream. Add some diced green chilies, olives, a pound of ground beef and more cheese, and you’ve got warm, full, happy bellies in no time! </p>

<p>
<ul>
	<b>Ingredients:</b>  
	<li>1 lb Ground Beef</li>
	<li>16 oz Sour Cream</li>
	<li>(3) 14 oz cans Cream of Chicken soup</li>
	<li>(1) 4 oz can Diced Green Chilies</li>
	<li>(1) 4 oz can Sliced Olives</li>
	<li>1 lb Shredded Mexican Cheese</li>
	<li>(12) flour tortillas</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>So how exactly is it made?</b></p> 
<p>In just a few simple steps, you’ll have this in the oven and your family’s tummy’s full in about an hour!</p>

<p>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.</li>
	<li>Spray a 13x9 glass baking pan with cooking spray. </li>
	<li>Next, brown your ground beef, breaking apart as you go. Drain grease once fully cooked.</li>
	<li>In a large bowl, mix together the cream of chicken, sour cream and diced green chilies.</li>
	<li>Spread a thin, even layer of the cream of chicken mixture onto the entire face of your first tortilla.</li>
	<li>Sprinkle about 1/8 cup ground beef, followed by about the same amount of cheese.</li>
	<li>Roll tightly and place in baking pan.</li>
	<li>Repeat until you have made 12 enchiladas. It will be snug in the pan!!</li>
	<li>Top the enchiladas with the remaining cream of chicken mixture, then sprinkle more cheese to your liking.</li>
	<li>Add slice olives sprinkled on top. Note: If there is any left over ground beef, just sprinkle that on the top of the casserole with the olives. </li>
	<li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.</li>
	<li>Let stand for 5 minutes and serve.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>That’s it! Super easy and oh so yummy! We usually have leftovers and eat it for a day or two because these are filling.</p>
